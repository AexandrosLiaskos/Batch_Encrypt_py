# Batch_Encrypt_py
This project provides an automated system for encrypting Python scripts using AES encryption. It includes tools to batch encrypt .py files, generate and store secure keys for each file, and optionally remove the original scripts post-encryption. The aim is to offer a secure and efficient method for protecting Python source code.
